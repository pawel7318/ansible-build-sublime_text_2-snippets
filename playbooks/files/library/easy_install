    description:
      - Whether the virtual environment will inherit packages from the
        global site-packages directory.  Note that if this setting is

  executable:
    description:
      - The explicit executable or a pathname to the executable to be used to
        run easy_install for a specific version of Python installed in the
        system. For example C(easy_install-3.3), if there are both Python 2.7
        and 3.3 installations in the system and you want to run easy_install
        for the Python 3.3 installation.
    version_added: "1.3"
    required: false
    default: null
notes:
    - Please note that the M(easy_install) module can only install Python
      libraries. Thus this module is not able to remove libraries. It is
      generally recommended to use the M(pip) module which you can first install
      using M(easy_install).
    - Also note that I(virtualenv) must be installed on the remote host if the
      C(virtualenv) parameter is specified.
