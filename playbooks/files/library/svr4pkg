module: svr4pkg
short_description: Manage Solaris SVR4 packages
description:
    - Manages SVR4 packages on Solaris 10 and 11.
    - These were the native packages on Solaris <= 10 and are available
      as a legacy feature in Solaris 11.
    - Note that this is a very basic packaging system. It will not enforce
      dependencies on install or remove.
