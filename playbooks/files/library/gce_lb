module: gce_lb
version_added: "1.5"
short_description: create/destroy GCE load-balancer resources
description:
    - This module can create and destroy Google Compute Engine C(loadbalancer)
      and C(httphealthcheck) resources.  The primary LB resource is the
      C(load_balancer) resource and the health check parameters are all
      prefixed with I(httphealthcheck).
      The full documentation for Google Compute Engine load balancing is at
      U(https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/).  However,
      the ansible module simplifies the configuration by following the
      libcloud model.
      Full install/configuration instructions for the gce* modules can
      be found in the comments of ansible/test/gce_tests.py.
