notes:
   - Requires the MySQLdb Python package on the remote host. For Ubuntu, this
     is as easy as apt-get install python-mysqldb. (See M(apt).)
   - Both I(login_password) and I(login_user) are required when you are
     passing credentials. If none are present, the module will attempt to read
     the credentials from C(~/.my.cnf), and finally fall back to using the MySQL
     default login of C(root) with no password.
