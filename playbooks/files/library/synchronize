module: synchronize
version_added: "1.4"
short_description: Uses rsync to make synchronizing file paths in your playbooks quick and easy.
description:
    - This is a wrapper around rsync. Of course you could just use the command action to call rsync yourself, but you also have to add a fair number of boilerplate options and host facts. You still may need to call rsync directly via C(command) or C(shell) depending on your use case. The synchronize action is meant to do common things with C(rsync) easily. It does not provide access to the full power of rsync, but does make most invocations easier to follow.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - Path on the source machine that will be synchronized to the destination; The path can be absolute or relative.

    required: true
  dest_port:
    description:
      - Port number for ssh on the destination host. The ansible_ssh_port inventory var takes precedence over this value.

    version_added: "1.5"

  rsync_path:

    default: 0
    required: false
  set_remote_user:
    description:
      - put user@ for the remote paths. If you have a custom ssh config to define the remote user for a host
        that does not match the inventory user, you should set this parameter to "no".
    default: yes
  rsync_opts:
    description:
      - Specify additional rsync options by passing in an array.
    default:
    required: false
    version_added: "1.6"
notes:
   - Inspect the verbose output to validate the destination user/host/path
     are what was expected.
   - The remote user for the dest path will always be the remote_user, not
     the sudo_user. 
   - Expect that dest=~/x will be ~<remote_user>/x even if using sudo.
   - To exclude files and directories from being synchronized, you may add 
     C(.rsync-filter) files to the source directory.
