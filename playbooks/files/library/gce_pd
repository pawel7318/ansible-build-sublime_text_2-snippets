module: gce_pd
version_added: "1.4"
short_description: utilize GCE persistent disk resources
description:
    - This module can create and destroy unformatted GCE persistent disks
      U(https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#persistentdisks).
      It also supports attaching and detaching disks from running instances
      but does not support creating boot disks from images or snapshots.  The
      'gce' module supports creating instances with boot disks.
      Full install/configuration instructions for the gce* modules can
      be found in the comments of ansible/test/gce_tests.py.
