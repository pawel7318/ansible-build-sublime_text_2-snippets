version_added: "0.1"
short_description:  Manage services.
description:
    - Controls services on remote hosts.
options:
    name:
        required: true
        description:
        - Name of the service.
    state:
        required: false
        choices: [ started, stopped, restarted, reloaded ]
        description:
          - C(started)/C(stopped) are idempotent actions that will not run
            commands unless necessary.  C(restarted) will always bounce the
            service.  C(reloaded) will always reload. B(At least one of state
            and enabled are required.)
    sleep:
        required: false
        version_added: "1.3"
        description:
        - If the service is being C(restarted) then sleep this many seconds
          between the stop and start command. This helps to workaround badly
          behaving init scripts that exit immediately after signaling a process
          to stop.
    pattern:
        required: false
        version_added: "0.7"
        description:
        - If the service does not respond to the status command, name a
          substring to look for as would be found in the output of the I(ps)
          command as a stand-in for a status result.  If the string is found,
          the service will be assumed to be running.
    enabled:
        required: false
        choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
        description:
        - Whether the service should start on boot. B(At least one of state and
          enabled are required.)

    runlevel:
        required: false
        default: 'default'
        description:
        - "For OpenRC init scripts (ex: Gentoo) only.  The runlevel that this service belongs to."
