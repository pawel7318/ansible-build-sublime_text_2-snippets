module: command
version_added: historical
short_description: Executes a command on a remote node
description:
     - The M(command) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
     - The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be
       processed through the shell, so variables like C($HOME) and operations
       like C("<"), C(">"), C("|"), and C("&") will not work (use the M(shell)
       module if you need these features).
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - the command module takes a free form command to run.  There is no parameter actually named 'free form'.
        See the examples!

  executable:
    description:

    version_added: "0.9"
notes:
    -  If you want to run a command through the shell (say you are using C(<),
       C(>), C(|), etc), you actually want the M(shell) module instead. The
       M(command) module is much more secure as it's not affected by the user's
       environment.
    -  " C(creates), C(removes), and C(chdir) can be specified after the command. For instance, if you only want to run a command if a certain file does not exist, use this."
