notes:
    - "If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in C(known_hosts).
      SSH will prompt user to authorize the first contact with a remote host.  To avoid this prompt, 
      one solution is to add the remote host public key in C(/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts) before calling 
      the hg module, with the following command: ssh-keyscan remote_host.com >> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts."
