notes:
  - The DNS Made Easy service requires that machines interacting with the API have the proper time and timezone set. Be sure you are within a few seconds of actual time by using NTP. 
  - This module returns record(s) in the "result" element when 'state' is set to 'present'. This value can be be registered and used in your playbooks.
