module: wait_for
short_description: Waits for a condition before continuing.
description:
     - Waiting for a port to become available is useful for when services 
       are not immediately available after their init scripts return - 
       which is true of certain Java application servers. It is also 
       useful when starting guests with the M(virt) module and
       needing to pause until they are ready. 
     - This module can also be used to wait for a regex match a string to be present in a file.
     - In 1.6 and later, this module can 
       also be used to wait for a file to be available or absent on the 
       filesystem.
