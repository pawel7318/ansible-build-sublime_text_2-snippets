    description:
      - If C(mounted) or C(unmounted), the device will be actively mounted or unmounted
        as well as just configured in I(fstab). C(absent) and C(present) only deal with
        I(fstab). C(mounted) will also automatically create the mount point
        directory if it doesn't exist. If C(absent) changes anything, it will
        remove the mount point directory.
