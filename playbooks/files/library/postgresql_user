module: postgresql_user
short_description: Adds or removes a users (roles) from a PostgreSQL database.
description:
   - Add or remove PostgreSQL users (roles) from a remote host and, optionally,
     grant the users access to an existing database or tables.
   - The fundamental function of the module is to create, or delete, roles from
     a PostgreSQL cluster. Privilege assignment, or removal, is an optional
     step, which works on one database at a time. This allows for the module to
     be called several times in the same module to modify the permissions on
     different databases, or to grant permissions to already existing users.
   - A user cannot be removed until all the privileges have been stripped from
     the user. In such situation, if the module tries to remove the user it
     will fail. To avoid this from happening the fail_on_user option signals
     the module to try to remove the user, but if not possible keep going; the
     module will report if changes happened and separately if the user was
     removed or not.

      - "When passing an encrypted password, the encrypted parameter must also be true, and it must be generated with the format C('str[\\"md5\\"] + md5[ password + username ]'), resulting in a total of 35 characters.  An easy way to do this is: C(echo \\"md5`echo -n \\"verysecretpasswordJOE\\" | md5`\\")."

notes:
   - The default authentication assumes that you are either logging in as or
     sudo'ing to the postgres account on the host.
   - This module uses psycopg2, a Python PostgreSQL database adapter. You must
     ensure that psycopg2 is installed on the host before using this module. If
     the remote host is the PostgreSQL server (which is the default case), then
     PostgreSQL must also be installed on the remote host. For Ubuntu-based
     systems, install the postgresql, libpq-dev, and python-psycopg2 packages
     on the remote host before using this module.
   - If you specify PUBLIC as the user, then the privilege changes will apply
     to all users. You may not specify password or role_attr_flags when the
     PUBLIC user is specified.
