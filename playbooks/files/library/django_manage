   - I(virtualenv) (U(http://www.virtualenv.org)) must be installed on the remote host if the virtualenv parameter is specified.
   - This module will create a virtualenv if the virtualenv parameter is specified and a virtualenv does not already exist at the given location.
   - This module assumes English error messages for the 'createcachetable' command to detect table existence, unfortunately.
   - To be able to use the migrate command, you must have south installed and added as an app in your settings
   - To be able to use the collectstatic command, you must have enabled staticfiles in your settings
