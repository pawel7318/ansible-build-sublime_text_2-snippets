module: ohai
short_description: Returns inventory data from I(Ohai)
description:
     - Similar to the M(facter) module, this runs the I(Ohai) discovery program
       (U(http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Ohai)) on the remote host and 
       returns JSON inventory data.
       I(Ohai) data is a bit more verbose and nested than I(facter).
