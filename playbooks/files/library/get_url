module: get_url
short_description: Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to node
description:
     - Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to the remote server. The remote
       server I(must) have direct access to the remote resource.
     - By default, if an environment variable C(<protocol>_proxy) is set on
       the target host, requests will be sent through that proxy. This
       behaviour can be overridden by setting a variable for this task
       (see `setting the environment
       <http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_environment.html>`_),
       or by using the use_proxy option.
version_added: "0.6"
options:
  url:
    description:
      - HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path
    required: true
    default: null
    aliases: []
  dest:
    description:
      - absolute path of where to download the file to.
      - If C(dest) is a directory, either the server provided filename or, if
        none provided, the base name of the URL on the remote server will be
        used. If a directory, C(force) has no effect.
        If C(dest) is a directory, the file will always be
        downloaded (regardless of the force option), but replaced only if the contents changed.
    required: true
    default: null
  force:
    description:
      - If C(yes) and C(dest) is not a directory, will download the file every
        time and replace the file if the contents change. If C(no), the file
        will only be downloaded if the destination does not exist. Generally
        should be C(yes) only for small local files. Prior to 0.6, this module
        behaved as if C(yes) was the default.
    version_added: "0.7"
    required: false
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    default: "no"
    aliases: [ "thirsty" ]
  sha256sum:
    description:
      - If a SHA-256 checksum is passed to this parameter, the digest of the
        destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to ensure
        its integrity and verify that the transfer completed successfully.
    version_added: "1.3"
    required: false
    default: null
  use_proxy:
    description:
      - if C(no), it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in
        an environment variable on the target hosts.
    required: false
    default: 'yes'
    choices: ['yes', 'no']
  validate_certs:
    description:
      - If C(no), SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used
        on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
    required: false
    default: 'yes'
    choices: ['yes', 'no']
  url_username:
    description:
      - The username for use in HTTP basic authentication. This parameter can be used
        without C(url_password) for sites that allow empty passwords.
    required: false
    version_added: '1.6'
  url_password:
    description:
      - The password for use in HTTP basic authentication. If the C(url_username)
        parameter is not specified, the C(url_password) parameter will not be used.
    required: false
