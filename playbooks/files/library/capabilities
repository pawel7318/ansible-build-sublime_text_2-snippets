module: capabilities
short_description: Manage Linux capabilities
description:
    - This module manipulates files privileges using the Linux capabilities(7) system.
version_added: "1.6"
options:
    path:
        description:
            - Specifies the path to the file to be managed.
        required: true
        default: null
    capability:
        description:
            - Desired capability to set (with operator and flags, if state is C(present)) or remove (if state is C(absent))
        required: true
        default: null
        aliases: [ 'cap' ]
    state:
        description:
            - Whether the entry should be present or absent in the file's capabilities.
        choices: [ "present", "absent" ]
        default: present
notes:
    - The capabilities system will automatically transform operators and flags
      into the effective set, so (for example, cap_foo=ep will probably become
      cap_foo+ep). This module does not attempt to determine the final operator
      and flags to compare, so you will want to ensure that your capabilities
      argument matches the final capabilities.
