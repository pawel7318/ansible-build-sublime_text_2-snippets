module: replace
author: Evan Kaufman
short_description: Replace all instances of a particular string in a
                   file using a back-referenced regular expression.
description:
  - This module will replace all instances of a pattern within a file.
  - It is up to the user to maintain idempotence by ensuring that the
    same pattern would never match any replacements made.
version_added: "1.6"
options:
  dest:
    required: true
    aliases: [ name, destfile ]
    description:
      - The file to modify.
  regexp:
    required: true
    description:
      - The regular expression to look for in the contents of the file.
        Uses Python regular expressions; see
        U(http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html).
        Uses multiline mode, which means C(^) and C($) match the beginning
        and end respectively of I(each line) of the file.
  replace:
    required: false
    description:
      - The string to replace regexp matches. May contain backreferences
        that will get expanded with the regexp capture groups if the regexp
        matches. If not set, matches are removed entirely.
  backup:
    required: false
    default: "no"
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    description:
      - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can
        get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
  validate:
    required: false
    description:
      - validation to run before copying into place
    required: false
