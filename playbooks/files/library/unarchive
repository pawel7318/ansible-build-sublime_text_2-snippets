todo:
    - detect changed/unchanged for .zip files
    - handle common unarchive args, like preserve owner/timestamp etc...
notes:
    - requires C(tar)/C(unzip) command on target host
    - can handle I(gzip), I(bzip2) and I(xz) compressed as well as uncompressed tar files
    - detects type of archive automatically
    - uses tar's C(--diff arg) to calculate if changed or not. If this C(arg) is not
      supported, it will always unpack the archive
    - does not detect if a .zip file is different from destination - always unzips
    - existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archive
      are not touched.  This is the same behavior as a normal archive extraction
    - existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archive
      are ignored for purposes of deciding if the archive should be unpacked or not
