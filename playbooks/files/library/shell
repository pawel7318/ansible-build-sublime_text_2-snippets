module: shell
short_description: Execute commands in nodes.
description:
     - The M(shell) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
       It is almost exactly like the M(command) module but runs
       the command through a shell (C(/bin/sh)) on the remote node.
version_added: "0.2"
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - The shell module takes a free form command to run, as a string.  There's not an actual
        option named "free form".  See the examples!

  chdir:
    description:

    required: false
    default: null
    version_added: "0.6"
  executable:
    description:
      - change the shell used to execute the command. Should be an absolute path to the executable.
    required: false
    default: null
    version_added: "0.9"
notes:
   -  If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be
      better to use the M(command) module instead. Best practices when writing
      playbooks will follow the trend of using M(command) unless M(shell) is
      explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best
      judgement.
