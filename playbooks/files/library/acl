      - DEPRECATED. The acl to set or remove.  This must always be quoted in the form of '<etype>:<qualifier>:<perms>'.  The qualifier may be empty for some types, but the type and perms are always requried. '-' can be used as placeholder when you do not care about permissions. This is now superceeded by entity, type and permissions fields.
