module: copy
version_added: "historical"
short_description: Copies files to remote locations.
description:
     - The M(copy) module copies a file on the local box to remote locations.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative.
        If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends
        with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination.
        Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents
        is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
    required: false

  content:
    version_added: "1.1"
    description:
      - When used instead of 'src', sets the contents of a file directly to the specified value.
    required: false
    default: null
  dest:
    description:
      - Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If src is a directory,
        this must be a directory too.
    required: true
    default: null
  backup:
    description:
      - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get
        the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    version_added: "0.7"
    required: false
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    default: "no"
  force:
    description:
      - the default is C(yes), which will replace the remote file when contents
        are different than the source.  If C(no), the file will only be transferred
        if the destination does not exist.
    version_added: "1.1"
    required: false
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    default: "yes"
    aliases: [ "thirsty" ]
  validate:
    description:
      - The validation command to run before copying into place.  The path to the file to
        validate is passed in via '%s' which must be present as in the visudo example below.
        The command is passed securely so shell features like expansion and pipes won't work.
    required: false
    default: ""
    version_added: "1.2"
  directory_mode:
    description:
      - When doing a recursive copy set the mode for the directories. If this is not set we will default the system
        defaults.
    required: false
    version_added: "1.5"

notes:
   - The "copy" module recursively copy facility does not scale to lots (>hundreds) of files.
     For alternative, see synchronize module, which is a wrapper around rsync.
