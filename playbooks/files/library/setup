        description:
            - path used for local ansible facts (*.fact) - files in this dir
              will be run (if executable) and their results be added to ansible_local facts
              if a file is not executable it is read.

description:
     - This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful
       variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. It can also be
       executed directly by C(/usr/bin/ansible) to check what variables are
       available to a host. Ansible provides many I(facts) about the system,
       automatically.
notes:
    - More ansible facts will be added with successive releases. If I(facter) or
      I(ohai) are installed, variables from these programs will also be snapshotted
      into the JSON file for usage in templating. These variables are prefixed
      with C(facter_) and C(ohai_) so it's easy to tell their source. All variables are
      bubbled up to the caller. Using the ansible facts and choosing to not
      install I(facter) and I(ohai) means you can avoid Ruby-dependencies on your
      remote systems. (See also M(facter) and M(ohai).)
    - The filter option filters only the first level subkey below ansible_facts.
    - If the target host is Windows, you will not currently have the ability to use
      C(fact_path) or C(filter) as this is provided by a simpler implementation of the module.
      Different facts are returned for Windows hosts.
