short_description: Assembles a configuration file from fragments
description:
     - Assembles a configuration file from fragments. Often a particular
       program will take a single configuration file and does not support a
       C(conf.d) style structure where it is easy to build up the configuration
       from multiple sources. M(assemble) will take a directory of files that can be
       local or have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them
       together to produce a destination file. Files are assembled in string sorting order.
       Puppet calls this idea I(fragments).

      - An already existing directory full of source files.

    required: true
    default: null
  backup:
    description:

    default: null
  remote_src:
    description:

  regexp:
    description:
      - Assemble files only if C(regex) matches the filename. If not set,
        all files are assembled. All "\\" (backslash) must be escaped as
        "\\\\" to comply yaml syntax. Uses Python regular expressions; see
        U(http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html).
