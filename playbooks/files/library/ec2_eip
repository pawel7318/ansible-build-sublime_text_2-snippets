notes:
   - This module will return C(public_ip) on success, which will contain the
     public IP address associated with the instance.
   - There may be a delay between the time the Elastic IP is assigned and when
     the cloud instance is reachable via the new address. Use wait_for and pause
     to delay further playbook execution until the instance is reachable, if
     necessary.
